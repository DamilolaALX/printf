### INTRODUCTION:
The printf function in C is used to print formatted output to the standard output stream. This project involves creating a custom implementation of the printf function that replicates the core functionalities of the standard printf in C, while adding enhancements or modifications as required.

### PROJECT GOALS:
The primary objectives of this project include:

* Implementing a custom printf function in C.
* Replicating the core functionalities of the standard printf in C.
* Enhancing or modifying the printf function to meet specific project requirements.
* Collaborative teamwork and learning through real-world application of software engineering concepts.

### CONTRIBUTORS:
This project is a collaborative effort by the following contributors:

### USAGE
To use the custom printf function, follow these steps:

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Include the printf function in your C source code.
* Call the printf function as needed in your code.

Example usage:
# c
```
#include "printf.h"

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
        return (0);
}
```
	
### TESTING:
To run the tests for the printf function, follow these steps:

* Navigate to the tests directory.
* Compile the test files.
* Run the compiled test executable.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
We would like to thank the ALX Software Engineering Course for providing the opportunity to work on this project and enhance our skills in software development.
